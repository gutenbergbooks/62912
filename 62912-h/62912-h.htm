<span class="smcap">Prologue</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Lo,</span> nowadays the earth is white
or green, according as Winter
rules or Spring. The thrush
sings in the grove and the
canary in his cage, the smoke
rises from the house-top and the
church-bell tolls for evensong.
The monk walks in the meadow
and the poet writes verse.</p>

<p>But once things were different.</p>

<p>Once things were so that, had
somebody taken a walk on the
earth, nowhere would a dog have
run out of a house and barked
at him. For there was not
upon all the earth a single dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
to run out of a house nor a
single house for a dog to run
out of.</p>

<p>He would not have come upon
a tree nor a flower nor a blade of
grass. Nor could he have
found a drop of water to quench
his thirst with.</p>

<p>For there was nobody on the
earth&mdash;nobody and nothing.</p>

<p><i>Had</i> there been anybody who
wanted to take a walk, he simply
could not have done so.
For the earth was mere vapour
and mist, so that he would have
fallen plump through her and
plunged straight into space,
where the stars float.</p>

<p>And he would not have had
much satisfaction from this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
For, unless he had been quite
round and nice and bright, he
would have cut a foolish figure
among the stars.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things.</p>

<p>But the earth quite understood
that she could not go on
like this for ever. She could not
have been intended to be never
more than smoke. So she
pulled herself together and did
her best. But she had to go
through a terrible amount and it
was a hard time for her, which
she never forgot and which she
bears the marks of to this day.</p>

<p>She had to go through fire and
through water too.</p>

<p>For thousands of years, she
flew through space like a ball of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
fire and, when at length she had
a stone crust about her, the rain
poured down upon her nor
stopped until she sailed away
like an enormous drop of water.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fire in the
earth&#8217;s interior broke out each
moment through the crust, burst
it and split it criss-crosswise
and flung the pieces higgledy-piggledy
to every side.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor, dear little Earth!&#8221;
said the sun and looked at her
kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you bother about
that clot?&#8221; asked one of the big
stars. &#8220;Shine on us, who are
worth shining on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The earth is no clot to me,&#8221;
replied the sun. &#8220;She is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
child, like yourself and the
others. And she is the youngest
and therefore nearest to my
heart. It is not so very many
thousand years ago since she
broke loose from me and sallied
forth into the universe to tempt
fortune single-handed. If only
she behaves pluckily and does
not lose heart, I shall have
pleasure enough in her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earth heard this and held
out.</p>

<p>Year by year, the stone crust
grew thicker, the water sank
gradually into the ground and
the land rose to the surface.
But, even when the crust became
so thick that the fire could
not break through it just when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
and where it pleased, but had to
make a regular effort when it
wished to create a sensation,
even then the earth&#8217;s trials were
not over.</p>

<p>There was no order about her
at all.</p>

<p>For instance, it was just as
warm in Greenland as in Italy.
Plenty of plants grew on the
earth, but they were queer ones:
ferns and horse-tails as tall as
the tallest trees in the forest
nowadays. There were animals
too, but they were strange
and uncanny creatures which
we never meet with now except
in the old fairy-tales. There
were quadrupeds that were
thirty yards long and swam in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
the water; and there were
dragons that flew in the air and
looked horrid.</p>

<p>And so it happened that it
became ridiculously cold on the
greatest part of the earth.
Wherever one looked lay ice and
snow; and the animals and
plants died.</p>

<p>But then the fire broke out
again, more violently than ever,
and overturned hills and dales.
Great new lands rose up out of
the sea; and the sea swept its
broad waves ruthlessly over the
old lands.</p>

<p>No one could conceive what
the end would be.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor, dear little Earth!&#8221;
said the sun.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>But how all these things were
put in order at last&mdash;this you
shall read in the fairy-tale of
<i>The Four Seasons</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smcap">The First Meeting</span></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>By the grace of God, conferred on</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Princes four, they share Earth&#8217;s burden:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Theirs the glory, hers the guerdon.</i></div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened one day that two
princes came walking over the
earth of each in the other&#8217;s
direction.</p>

<p>One of them came from the
North, the other from the South.
They were both tall, taller than
men, taller than any champion
of romance. They carried their
heads royally and high and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
their feet firmly upon the
ground, as if it belonged to them.</p>

<p>The one who came from the
North was the elder. He was
an old man with a might of
white hair and beard; his naked
breast was shaggy, shaggy his
legs and hands. He looked
strong and wild, with cold, stern
eyes.</p>

<p>The one who came from the
South was young, but no less
powerful than the other. His
face and hands were burned by
the sun, his eyes strong and
gentle as the sun. Over his
shoulder he wore a purple cloak,
round his loins a golden girdle.
In the girdle was a wonderful
red rose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>When the princes saw each
other from afar, they stopped
for a moment and then walked
quickly on again, as though
they longed to meet. But,
when they had come a little
closer to each other, they both
stood still once more. The
young one shivered when he met
the old one&#8217;s glance; and the
sweat sprang to the old one&#8217;s
brow when the young one looked
at him.</p>

<p>They stood thus for a time.
Then they sat down, each upon
a mountain, and gazed at each
other and waited for a while in
silence.</p>

<p>The young one was the first
to speak:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>&#8220;You are Winter, I presume?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>The old one nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Winter, the lord of the
earth,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The young one laughed till
the mountains rang:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really?&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And I am Summer, the lord of
the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat again for a while
and measured each other with
angry glances.</p>

<p>Then Winter said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I came out to meet you and
talk to you. But I do not like
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came intending to talk you
into your senses,&#8221; said Summer.
&#8220;But I can hardly bear to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at you, you are so grim and
ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we divide the earth
between us?&#8221; asked Winter.
&#8220;You come everywhere with
your namby-pamby sunshine
and melt my ice and plant your
paltry flowers. I retaliate, as
you know. I smother your creatures
in snow and spoil your
pleasure. We are both equally
strong: shall we conclude a
peace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would <i>that</i> lead to?&#8221;
asked Summer, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each of us must keep to his
own,&#8221; replied Winter. &#8220;I have
my ice-castle in the North,
where you can never come, and
you have your sun-palace down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in the South, where my sway
does not reach. As we cannot
bear the sight of each other, we
had better lay a broad waste belt
between our kingdoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing shall be waste,&#8221;
said Summer. &#8220;Everything shall
be green, as far as I am concerned.
I like to wander out of
my summer-palace all over the
earth and I will carry my light
and my heat as far into your ice-fields
as I can. I know no
greater pleasure than to conjure
forth a green spot in your snow
... even though it be but for a
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are conceited, because
you are in luck&#8217;s way for the
moment,&#8221; replied Winter. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
you should remember that the
times may change. I <i>was</i> the
more powerful once and I may
become so again. Do not forget
that I am born of the eternal,
unutterable cold of space.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am the child of the
sun and was powerful before
you,&#8221; said Summer, proudly.</p>

<p>Winter passed his fingers
through his beard; and an avalanche
came rushing down the
mountain-side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; said Summer and
wrapped himself closer in his
purple cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to see my
might?&#8221; asked Winter.</p>

<p>He raised his arms in the air;
and, then and there, the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
on which he sat was quite
transformed. A wild, blustering
storm roared over it; and the
snow swept down from the sky.
A brook which had been leaping
gaily over the slope turned suddenly
to ice; and the waterfall
which sang and hummed over
the precipice fell silent at once
and its water froze into yard-long
icicles. When it ceased
snowing, the mountain was
white from top to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s my turn,&#8221; said
Summer.</p>

<p>He took the rose from his
girdle and flung it on the mountain
whereon he sat; and forthwith
the loveliest roses shot up
from the ground. They nodded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the breeze from the point of
every rock and filled the valleys
with their fragrance and their
colours. In every bush sat
merry nightingales and sang;
and from the flower-stalks
heavy dew-drops hung and
gleamed in the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Summer.</p>

<p>Winter bent forward and
stared hard at the loveliest rose
of them all. Then the dew-drop
that hung under the flower
froze into an icicle. The bird
that sat in its branches and sang
fell stiff and frozen to the
ground; and the rose itself withered
and died.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Winter.</p>

<p>But Summer stood up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
looked with his gentle eyes at
Winter&#8217;s mountain, at the place
where the snow lay deepest.
And, on the spot at which he
looked, the snow melted and
from out the ground sprang the
largest and loveliest Christmas
rose that any one could hope to
set eyes upon.</p>

<p>In this wise, the two princes
could make no way against each
other.</p>

<p>The day wore on; evening
came and night. The moon
shone upon the splendid snow-clad
mountain, which gleamed
and glittered like diamonds.
Across from Summer&#8217;s mountain
sounded the nightingale&#8217;s
song; and the scent of the roses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
filled all the fair space around.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, just as the
sun was rising, two other princes
came walking towards the place
where Winter and Summer sat
glaring at each other.</p>

<p>One of them came from the
East, the other from the West.
They were shorter in stature
than Winter and Summer and
not so strong nor yet so awful to
look at. But they were big
enough even then; and there was
no mistaking that they were high
lords and mighty men. For
they walked the earth freely and
proudly and looked around them
as though they feared no one
and nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>The one who came from the
East was the younger, a mere
stripling without a hair on his
chin. His face was soft and
round, his mouth was ever smiling
and his eyes dreamy and
moist. His long hair was bound
with a ribbon, like a woman&#8217;s.
He was clad in green from top
to toe. The ribbon round his
hair was green, as were the bows
to his shoes; and a lute was slung
across his shoulder by a broad
green ribbon of silk. The newcomer
walked as gaily and
lightly as though his feet did
not touch the ground and, all
the time, as he walked, he
hummed a tune and plucked at
the strings of his lute.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>The one who came from the
West was much older. His
hair and beard were dashed with
grey; and there were wrinkles
on his forehead. But he was
good to look at and he was arrayed
in the most splendid attire
of them all. His cloak gleamed
red and brown and green and
yellow; and, as he marched
towards the sun, he spread it so
that it shone in all its colours.
He himself gazed contentedly
right into the sun&#8217;s radiance, as
if he could never have enough of
it. In his hand he carried a
mighty horn.</p>

<p>Now, when these two had
neared the others, they bowed
low before them. The one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
came from the East bowed lowest
before Summer; but the one
who came from the West showed
Winter the greatest deference.</p>

<p>Thereupon they sat down,
just opposite each other, each on
his mountain, and so they all
four sat for a while, in a circle,
and said nothing. Then Winter
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who may you two be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Autumn,&#8221; said he who
had come from the West.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Spring,&#8221; said the
other.</p>

<p>Winter looked hard at them
and shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never heard your
names,&#8221; said Summer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;We have come to rule over
the earth,&#8221; said Spring.</p>

<p>But now Winter grew angry
in earnest. He wrapped his
head in the most terrible snow-storm
that had ever been seen
in the land; and his voice
sounded like thunder from out
of the storm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, back to whence
you came! We do not know
you and we have nothing to say
to you. Summer and I are the
princes of the earth; and we already
are one prince too many.
If more come, it will simply
mean endless trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not come to cause
trouble, but to make peace,&#8221; said
Autumn, gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;Between Winter and me no
peace is possible,&#8221; said Summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why we want to part
you,&#8221; said Spring. &#8220;We two
who have come to-day well know
that we are not so powerful as
you. We bow respectfully before
you, because your might is
greater, your sway more firmly
established. We do not presume
to encroach on your dominions.
But we want to come
between you and hinder you
from laying waste the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you could do <i>that</i>!&#8221;
said Summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, then there would be
some sense in it,&#8221; growled Winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can,&#8221; said Autumn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
&#8220;We understand you both, because
we have something of both
of you in us. When you approach
each other, one of us two
will step in between; and the
land where we are shall then be
ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never let go my ice-castle
in the North!&#8221; cried Winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will suffer no foreign
prince in my sun-palace in the
South!&#8221; cried Summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more you shall,&#8221; said
Autumn. &#8220;None shall disturb
you in the places where you
reign in your might. But now
listen to me. When you two
move over the earth, Spring and
I will always come between you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and soften the tracks of the one
who is going and clear the way
for the one who is coming. In
this wise, we will reign for a
while, each in his own time and
each for a fourth part of the
year. We will follow after one
another in a circle which shall
never be broken nor changed.
And thus the poor earth will
gain peace and order in her affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Prince of Autumn
had spoken, they were all silent
for a while and looked out before
them. Winter and Summer
distrusted each other and
neither of them would utter the
first word. But Spring and
Autumn half rose from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
seats and bowed before the two
mighty ones:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will spread the cloth for
Summer,&#8221; said Spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make Winter&#8217;s bed,&#8221;
said Autumn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will release earth and water
from their icy fetters and prepare
them for your glory, O
beauteous Summer,&#8221; said Spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall bite your heel!&#8221;
roared Winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will make room for
your storms and snows, O stern
Winter,&#8221; said Autumn. &#8220;But
first I will bring Summer&#8217;s produce
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send my last sunbeams
after you and give you
lovely days,&#8221; said Summer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Again the four princes sat silent
and gazed out over the
earth.</p>

<p>And again evening came and
night. The moon shone upon
the snow-clad mountain, Summer&#8217;s
roses shed their scent,
Spring hummed a tune and
plucked at the strings of his
lute, Autumn&#8217;s motley cloak
flapped in the wind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, Winter
rose and stood upon his mountain,
all tall and mighty. The
other princes did as he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it be so then!&#8221; said Winter.
&#8220;For a hundred thousand
years it shall be so and no otherwise.
When that time is past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
we shall meet here again and
talk of how things have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the four princes bowed
to one another and strode away
across the earth.</p>

CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smcap">Spring</span></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>In azure now out of grey mist grew</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>My own sweet violet, shy and blue,</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>With eyes of smiling sunshine</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And tears of diamond dew.</i></div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince of Winter sat on
the mountains and gazed upon
the valley.</p>

<p>He knew that Spring must
soon be here and anxiously
looked out for him. But there
was nothing to see but snow and
snow and yet more snow; and he
began to think that young
Spring was afraid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>He laughed scornfully and
sent his gales howling round the
mountain-peaks. Wildly they
rushed over the hills, snapped
great trees in the wood and
broke the ice on the river to
pieces. They drove the floes
before them, flung them over the
meadows and whipped the water
into foam.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there!&#8221; said Winter.
&#8220;Softly, my children, softly!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bade them go down again;
and, grumbling, they crept
round behind the mountains.</p>

<p>When night came and the
stars twinkled, Winter stared at
the river with his cold eyes; and
there and then there was ice
again upon the water. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
waves broke it into two at once.
They leapt and danced and
cracked the thin crust each time
that it formed over them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; asked Winter,
in surprise.</p>

<p>At that moment, a soft song
sounded far down in the valley:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Play up! Play soon!</div>
<div class="verse">Keep time! Keep tune!</div>
<div class="indent">Ye wavelets, blue and tender!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Winter clutched his great
beard and leant forward to listen.
Now the song sounded
again and louder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Play up! Play soon!</div>
<div class="verse">Keep time! Keep tune!</div>
<div class="indent">Ye wavelets, blue and tender!</div>
<div class="verse">Keep tune! Keep time!</div>
<div class="verse">Burst ice and rime</div>
<div class="indent">In equinoctial splendour!</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Up sprang Winter and stared,
with his hand over his brows.</p>

<p>Down below in the valley
stood the Prince of Spring,
young and straight, in his green
garb, with the lute slung over his
shoulder. His long hair flowed
in the wind, his face was soft
and round, his mouth was ever
smiling, his eyes were dreamy
and moist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come too soon!&#8221; shouted
Winter.</p>

<p>But Spring bowed low and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I come by our appointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come too soon!&#8221; shouted
Winter again. &#8220;I am not
nearly done. I have a thousand
bags full of snow and my gales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
are just as strong and biting as
they were in January.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is your affair, not mine,&#8221;
said Spring, calmly. &#8220;Your
time is past now, and my sway is
beginning. Withdraw in peace
to your mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Winter folded his
strong, hairy hands and looked
anxiously at Spring:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a short respite!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I implore you to grant
me a little delay. Give me a
month, a week; give me just
three poor days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spring did not answer, but
looked out over the valley, as
though he had not heard, and
loosened the green silk ribbon
by which he carried his lute.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>But the Prince of Winter
stamped on the mountains till
they shook and clenched his fists
in mighty anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to whence you
came,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or I shall turn
my snows over you and bury you
so deep that you will never find
your way out of the valley. I
shall let loose my storms till
your wretched strains are
drowned in their roaring.
Your song shall freeze in your
throat. Wherever you walk or
stand, I shall follow your
tracks. Whatever you call
forth by day I shall slay by
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spring raised his head and
strode through the valley. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
plucked harder at the strings of
his lute and every tree in the
forest bent forward to listen.
The earth sighed under the
snow, the waves of the river
stood still and heard and then
joined in the song, as they leapt
towards the sea. Winter himself
swallowed his anger for a
moment and listened to Spring&#8217;s
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In vain thy prayer would soften, in vain thy menace frighten;</div>
<div class="verse">Behind the blackest cloud-wrack, the sunbeams laugh and lighten.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It rang through the valley in
long, loud, solemn tones; and
Echo answered from every hill
and mountain.</p>

<p>But Winter shook his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
clenched fists to the sky and
shouted aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Out, all my mighty storms!
Out with you, out! Burst down
upon the valley and shatter and
destroy all this! Rush over the
hills and snap every tree in the
forest! Overturn the mountains,
if you can, and crush yonder
green mountebank beneath
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Out rushed the storm; and the
snow came. It was awful
weather. The trees creaked and
crashed and fell, the river overflowed
its banks, the foam of the
waves spurted right up to the
sky, great avalanches of snow
poured down the mountain-slope.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>But Spring went his way
through the valley and sang, in
ever fuller and stronger tones:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Let all thy loud winds bluster, let all thy tempest bellow;</div>
<div class="verse">Let all thy white, bright snow-birds loose, across the meadow flying!</div>
<div class="verse">Behold my foot is on the bridge and all the ice-flowers dying!</div>
<div class="verse">Thou knowest thy power in the vale has met its conquering fellow.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Better than that!&#8221; shouted
Winter. &#8220;Roar, storm; whirl,
snow; lash, rain; beat, hail!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the storm roared louder;
and the snow whirled down. It
grew as dark as though the sun,
the moon and all the stars had
been put out. Great blocks of
stone rolled down over the valley;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the mountains shook and
split. It was as though the end
of the world had come.</p>

<p>But high through the murk
shone Spring&#8217;s green garb; and
louder than storm and thunder
rang his song. Earth and air
and water sang with him: the
poorest blade of grass beneath
the snow, the crow in the wood,
the worm in the mould, each of
them joined in the song according
to its power. Even the trees
that fell in the forest under the
onslaught of the storm confessed
Spring in the hour of their
death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thou knowest it were best to yield to save thy might from falling;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou knowest I am come to drape the porch of Summer&#8217;s palace.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Thy victims, harried on the hills and murdered in the valleys,</div>
<div class="verse">Awake to life, to happy life, at my soft song&#8217;s recalling.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then Winter gave in.</p>

<p>The storm flew north over the
mountains with a howl; and it
stopped snowing. The river
returned to its bed. Now and
again there was a crash in the
forest, when a branch that had
been struck by lightning fell to
the ground. Otherwise all was
still.</p>

<p>And then it began to thaw.</p>

<p>The snow had often sparkled
in the sun and rejoiced, but that
was a different sun from the one
that now stared down upon it.
The sun now riding in the sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
disliked the snow and the snow
disliked the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth do <i>you</i> want
here?&#8221; asked the sun and stared
with ever-increasing curiosity.</p>

<p>And the snow felt quite awkward
and wished itself miles
away. It melted up above till
great holes came; and it melted
down below till it suddenly collapsed
and turned to nothing,
more or less. Everywhere
underneath it, the water ran in
rills: through the wood, down
the hillside, over the meadow,
out in the river, which carried it
patiently to the sea. Everywhere
stood puddles of water, large and
small; they soaked slowly into
the ground, as its frozen crust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
disappeared by degrees. But
sometimes they had to wait, for
the ground was hard put to it to
drink so much at a time.</p>

<p>And, while it thawed, harder
and harder, and the coat of snow
grew thinner every day, Spring
stood on the edge of the wood
and bowed to the earth and
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My little snowdrop, gentle sprite,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy heart was ever brave and bright.</div>
<div class="verse">Not once it faltered, pierced with fright,</div>
<div class="indent">At Winter&#8217;s white wrath bleeding.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Under Spring&#8217;s song, a hundred
snowdrops burst from the
ground and shone forth white
and green. They nodded their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
heavy heads; and Spring nodded
to them. But then he went on,
till he stopped again, farther
away, and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And quick, each tiny crocus, too,</div>
<div class="verse">Put on your frocks of daintiest hue,</div>
<div class="verse">Frocks yellow, white and dusky-blue,</div>
<div class="indent">In full first clusters leading!</div>
</div></div>

<p>The crocuses at once opened
their flowers and strutted, short
as they were, for they were ever
so proud of being among the
first. But, while they were still
swarming out, already Spring
was in a fresh place and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Climb, whitlow-grass, thy willow-mast!</div>
<div class="verse">O where art thou? Yet sleeping fast?</div>
<div class="verse">Thou wast not wont to enter last:</div>
<div class="indent">Up, lower plants preceding!</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>And all the willow-branches
were filled forthwith with the
yellow flowers of the whitlow-grass,
which nodded gladly to the
crocuses and snowdrops. And
Spring sang again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Dear fresh spurge-laurel, briskly grow!</div>
<div class="verse">Thou, whose keen lance with fiery glow</div>
<div class="verse">Would burst the lap of the cold snow,</div>
<div class="indent">Come forth: obey my pleading!</div>
</div></div>

<p>There stood the spurge-laurel,
like a bright-red birch-rod ready
for use on Ash Wednesday.
But Spring pulled the lower
branches of the bush aside and
bent still more deeply towards
the ground and sang more softly
than ever:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thou of all symbols, dearest yet,</div>
<div class="verse">My true, my lovely violet!</div>
<div class="verse">Soon sun will burn, soon rain will wet:</div>
<div class="indent">Be ready, no call needing!</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the violet shot up its
broad green leaves from the
ground to show Spring that it
was ready.</p>

<p>Then the mist floated out over
the valley. No one could see
where it came from, but it came
and remained for many a long
day.</p>

<p>They were strange, silent
days. Everywhere, everything
oozed and bubbled and rustled
and seethed in the ground; and
there was not a sound besides.
Noiselessly, the mist glided over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the hills and into the woods and
hung heavy dew-drops on every
single twig. And the dew-drops
dripped and fell from
morn till eve and from eve till
morn.</p>

<p><i>So</i> thick was the mist that the
river was hidden in it, till one
could only hear it flow. And
the hills were hidden and the
woods, till one saw nothing but
the outside trees and even that
only as shadows against the
damp, grey wall of mist.</p>

<p>But where the mist was thickest
there was Spring. And the
thicker the mist grew the
brighter shone Spring&#8217;s green
garb. And, all the time that the
water oozed and the dew-drops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
dripped and the river flowed,
Spring sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Softly slipping,</div>
<div class="verse">Little drop, go dripping, dripping!</div>
</div></div>

<p>But up in the mountains lay
the Prince of Winter and
lurked. He saw how the snow
melted and disappeared; he
saw the flowers come and could
do nothing to prevent it. The
snow melted right up in the
mountains; and he felt that it
would become a bad business
indeed if he did not put a stop
to it.</p>

<p>So he stole down to the valley
in the darkness of the night;
and, next morning, there was ice
on the puddles and the mist lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
beaten down upon the meadow
in sparkling hoar-frost.</p>

<p>But, when the young Prince
of Spring saw this, he only
laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no use,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then he raised his young face
to the sky and called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sun! Sun!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the sun appeared.</p>

<p>The clouds parted at once;
and the sun melted the ice and
the hoar-frost. Then he hid
again behind the clouds. The
mist floated over the hills anew,
everything oozed and bubbled
and rustled and dripped. The
snowdrop and the crocus and the
willow-wood blossomed that it
was a joy to see; and the violet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cautiously stuck its buds above
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now all is well!&#8221; said Spring.</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, a sprightly
wind came darting over the hills.</p>

<p>It shook the dew-drops from
the boughs of the trees, till they
fell to the ground in a splashing
rain. Then it fluttered through
the old dry grass in the meadow,
crested the waves of the river and
scattered the mist in no time.
Then it set about drying the wet
ground and drove the clouds
over the mountains. There they
remained hanging and hid the
angry face of Winter. But,
day after day, the sun rode in a
bright blue sky; and it grew
warm in the valley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Then the violet burst forth.
It hid bashfully among its broad
green leaves, but its scent spread
wide over the meadow. And
Spring plucked at the strings of
his lute and sang till the valley
rang again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In azure now out of grey mist grew</div>
<div class="verse">My own sweet violet, shy and blue,</div>
<div class="indent">With eyes of smiling sunshine</div>
<div class="verse">And tears of diamond dew.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And, when Spring had sung
<i>that</i> song&mdash;and it rang to the
top of the mountain, to the bottom
of the river, to the very ends
of the valley&mdash;then everything
came on at about the same time
and at a pace that can hardly be
described.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>At night, the valley was full
of sound. But none could hear
it whose heart was not full of
green boughs. For it was the
sound of buds bursting, little
green sheaths unrolling, twigs
stretching, flowers opening, scent
spreading and grass growing.</p>

<p>By day, it was sometimes sunshine
and sometimes rain, but
always good. And what happened
then could be seen by any
one who had eyes to see with.</p>

<p>First, the ground in the wood
became quite white with anemones.
So white did it all become
that the Prince of Winter, who
was peeping down through a rift
in the clouds, thought for a moment
that there was snow. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was gladder than he had been
since February. But, when he
saw his mistake, he stole into the
wood one night, for the last time,
and bit in two the necks of all
the flowers that he could.</p>

<p>But a thousand new ones came
for every one that died. And in
the midst of the anemones stood
the larkspur and the lungwort,
which had blue and red flowers,
to suit your fancy; the star of
Bethlehem, which was a bright
golden-yellow, but modest nevertheless;
the wood-sorrel, which
was so delicate that it withered if
you but touched it; the cowslip;
and the speedwell, which was
small enough, but very blue and
proud as Lucifer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>The meadow got itself a
brand-new grass carpet, ornamented
with yellow patches of
buttercups and dandelions.
Along the ditches it was bordered
with dear little cuckoo-flowers
and out towards the river
it had a fringe of rushes that
grew broader and thicker day by
day. Below, from the bottom
of the lake, sprang the water-lily&#8217;s
thick stalks, vying one with
the other who should reach the
surface first; and the frogs,
who had been sitting in the
mud and moping all through the
winter, crawled out and stretched
their hindlegs and swam up
and uttered their first &#8220;Quack!
Quack!&#8221; in such a way that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
could not have helped feeling
touched.</p>

<p>But the crows and the sparrows
and the chaffinches, who
had spent the winter down in the
valley, raised so great a hubbub
that it seemed as though they
had taken leave of their senses.
They ran round the meadow and
pecked at the soft ground and
nibbled at the grass, though
they knew quite well that it
would disagree with them. They
flapped their wings and shouted,
&#8220;Hurrah for Spring!&#8221; in a way
that showed they meant it. The
tit was there too and the wren,
small as she was. For they had
been there all the time, like the
others, and fared just as hard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>And the crow simply did not
know which leg to stand upon.
He started a croaking-match
with his old woman, with whom
he had lived the year before and
all through the winter and with
whom, since last February, he
had had a great quarrel about a
dead stickleback. The sparrow
sat down beside <i>his</i> missus, stuck
his nose in the air and sang as
though he were the nightingale
himself. The tit was perfectly
delirious with spring. He shut
his eyes and told his mate the
maddest stories about delicious
worms and big, fat flies that flew
right down your throat without
your having to stir a wing. And
Mr. Chaffinch got himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
grand new red shirt-front, which
made Mrs. Chaffinch nearly
swoon away with admiration.
But the wren, whose husband
had died of hunger at Christmas,
preened and polished her feathers
so that she might be taken for
the young and lively widow that
she was.</p>

<p>And the Prince of Spring
laughed and nodded kindly to
them:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a smart lot, one and
all of you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And you
have gone through trouble and
deserve a happy day. But now
I must get hold of my own
birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the South and
clapped his hands and sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Come, sweet lark and siskin small,</div>
<div class="indent">Blackcap, do not dally!</div>
<div class="verse">Swallow, thrush, come one, come all!</div>
<div class="indent">Spring is in the valley.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Up and down fly all day through,</div>
<div class="indent">Fear no wintry shadow!</div>
<div class="verse">Earth is green and heaven is blue,</div>
<div class="indent">Flowers spring in the meadow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Singing, piping, hasten here!</div>
<div class="indent">Come, each tuneful darling!</div>
<div class="verse">Come from far and come from near,</div>
<div class="indent">Lapwing, stork and starling!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the air hummed with the
beat of a thousand wings and the
army of birds of passage fell like
a host upon the valley. Each
night the air was vocal with the
passing of the birds; and in
the morning there was no end
to the twittering.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>There sat the starling and
whistled in his black dress-coat,
with all the orders on his breast.
The swallow swept through the
air; siskin and linnet, nightingale
and blackcap hopped
about in the copsewood. The
reed-warbler struck his trills in
the rushes along the river-banks
so touchingly that one could
weep to hear it, the thrush took
the deep notes and the goldfinch
the high ones, the cuckoo ventured
upon his first call and
the lapwing sat on his mound
and swaggered. But the stork
walked in the meadow and never
vouchsafed a smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the whole wood
had come out, but the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
were still small, so that the sun
was able to peep down at the
anemones. Lilies of the valley
distilled their fragrance for
dainty nostrils and woodruffs
theirs for noses of the humbler
sort. The green flowers of the
beech dangled from the new
thin twigs; cherry and blackthorn
were white from top to toe;
valerian and star of Bethlehem
and lousewort did their best.
The shepherd&#8217;s pouch, that blossomed
the whole year round, was
annoyed that no one took any
notice of it, but the orchis stood
and looked mysterious and uncanny,
because it had such
strange tubers in the ground.</p>

<p>Far in the beech-thicket, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it was greenest and prettiest, sat
a lovesick siskin and courted his
sweetheart, who hopped on a
twig beside him and looked as if
she simply could not understand
what he was driving at.</p>

<p>He sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If only, love, thou wilt be mine,</div>
<div class="indent">If now my singing heard is,</div>
<div class="verse">A nest I&#8217;ll give thee soft and fine</div>
<div class="indent">With four delightful birdies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Where rows of beech a glade enfold,</div>
<div class="indent">We&#8217;ll build with toil and trembling;</div>

<div class="verse">Of flies such multitudes I&#8217;ll find</div>
<div class="indent">As no words could ensure thee.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<div class="verse">At dawn of day I labour will,</div>
<div class="indent">The nest shall be thy keeping;</div>
<div class="verse">Each night, when sunset seeks the hill,</div>
<div class="indent">I&#8217;ll serenade thee sleeping.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When he had sung his ditty to
the end, he looked hard at her
and, as she did not answer him
at once, he gave her a sound peck
with his beak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But, when he ceased pecking
at her and raised his wings, as
though he meant to fly away, she
hastened to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yes, I will be thy own dear love,</div>
<div class="indent">Of bairns we&#8217;ll prate together;</div>
<div class="verse">With few would I have flown, dear love;</div>
<div class="indent">So preen a prouder feather!</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>Then they flew singing
through the wood. And they
were hardly gone before two
other birds came and sat on the
same twig and sang the same
thing in another manner.</p>

<p>But the leaves of the beech
grew and there came more and
more. They gathered closer
and closer over the wood and, one
fine day, it was quite impossible
for the sun to find a hole to
peep through.</p>

<p>Then the anemones became
seriously frightened:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine on us, Sun, or we shall
die!&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>They cried to the wind to
sweep the horrid leaves away, so
that the sun could see his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dear little anemones. They cried
to the beech that it ought to be
ashamed of itself, great, strong
tree that it was, for wishing
to kill innocent flowers. They
cried to Spring to help them in
their distress.</p>

<p>But the sun did not see them
and Spring did not hear them
and the beech took no heed of
them and the wind laughed at
them. There was such gladness
in the valley that it drowned
their voices; and they died quite
unnoticed.</p>

<p>Every single day, new flowers
came which were radiant and fragrant.
Every single day, the
birds discovered a new trill to
add to their song. The stag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
belled in the glade, before even
the sun was up, and the hind
answered and sprang. Every
second, the fish leapt in the water;
and there was no end to the
croaking of the frogs in the
ditch. The snake wriggled
along the edge of the brook and
made play with his tongue; in
every hedge sat small brown
mice exchanging amorous looks.
Even the flies buzzed more
fondly than usual.</p>

<p>But, when the gladness was at
its highest, the young Prince of
Spring stood at the top of the
valley, where the mountains enclose
it towards the North.
He looked out over his kingdom.
His eyes were moist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dreamy, his mouth was ever
smiling. He loosened from his
shoulder the green silk ribbon in
which his lute was slung,
plucked once more at the strings
and hummed to its accompaniment.
It was a beautiful, hazy
day, a day on which the birds
subdued their songs and the
flowers closed their petals.</p>

<p>And Spring bowed over a
little blue flower that sprouted
at his foot and sang, sadly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Forget-me-not blue,</div>
<div class="indent">Thou dreamy one,</div>
<div class="indent">Thou charming one,</div>
<div class="indent">Thou sweet one!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then he went northwards.
And, wherever he set his foot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the snow melted and the flowers
burst forth.</p>

<p>But, when he had come to
the last place from which he
could see the valley, he turned
round.</p>

<p>And far away towards the
South, where the valley runs
into the plain, stood the Prince
of Summer, tall and straight.
His face and his hands were
brown with the sun, his eyes
gentle and warm as the sun.
Over his shoulder he wore a
purple cloak, around his loins a
golden girdle. In the girdle
was a wonderful red rose.</p>

<p>Then Spring bowed low and
went away over the mountains.</p>

<span class="smcap">Summer</span></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Now bosky darkness grows.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The gradual summer-light bestows</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Faint star-light on each hollow.</i></div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">None</span> had noticed Spring&#8217;s farewell
or Summer&#8217;s coming.</p>

<p>The birds sang and the flies
buzzed. The gnats danced up
and down in the air, till the swallow
broke up the ball; the flowers
smelt sweet, the frogs croaked,
the stag belled in the glade.
There was no end to the universal
gladness.</p>

<p>And, while the mountains
were still turning green wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Spring had set his foot, right
up to Winter&#8217;s eternal snows on
the peaks, the Prince of Summer
stood for a time and surveyed
the kingdom which Spring had
quitted.</p>

<p>His form sent forth so sunny
a radiance that it grew hotter in
the valley than it ever had been.
His eyes shone, his purple cloak
beamed, the golden girdle around
his loins blazed like fire,
the red rose in his girdle glowed.</p>

<p>When he had stood a while, he
raised his hand, as though he
would bid them be still. But
none heeded him. The siskin
hopped in the thicket with his
sweetheart, gave her loving looks
and pecked at her with his beak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The fish sported merrily in the
water, the meadow displayed all
its glories and the wood stood
lost in green dreams.</p>

<p>The Prince of Summer smiled
and raised his hand once more.
When this had no effect, he
knitted his brows and his face
darkened.</p>

<p>And, at that moment, a veil
passed over the sun. From
east and west, thick clouds came
slowly over the hills, thicker
and blacker than the valley had
yet seen and with strange, thick
edges. From the clouds rolled
the thunder, distant and muffled,
but such that none could doubt
its power.</p>

<p>The clouds came nearer and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
grew ever darker, but no less hot
for that. Inside the wood, it
was as though it were evening.
The wind took fright and ran
away behind the hills and subsided.
The air was singularly
close and heavy. The leaves of
the trees hung slack, as though
they were sick, and the flowers
hastened to shut their petals.
No one knew what became of the
flies, but they were gone. The
little brown mice forgot their
amorous nonsense and sat in
their parlours and squeaked.
The stag took shelter behind the
thickest bushes; the croak of the
frogs stuck in their throats and
they went down to the bottom as
if Winter were at the door. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
birds looked round under the
leafage and stared with frightened
eyes.</p>

<p>And the Prince of Summer
was no longer all light and sunshine.
Gradually, as the clouds
closed up, the radiance that
flowed from him was extinguished.
At last, he stood at
the end of the valley like a
mighty black cloud in a warrior&#8217;s
form.</p>

<p>Then there suddenly came a
humming over the hills till every
breath of wind had left them
altogether. The trees bent low
in great dismay; the river rose
and leapt away like a horse that
rears and shies.</p>

<p>Then it sounded as if a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
light feet were running
over the ground: it was the first
rain-drops coming. The next
moment, the rain poured down
till every sound was drowned
in its splashing.</p>

<p>There came a terrible lightning,
which made everything
visible, but which dazzled all
eyes, so that they could not see.
Then came the blackest darkness
and then the thunder, till the
mountains shook again.</p>

<p>But through the thunder
sounded Summer&#8217;s accents; and
never had any heard so loud a
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I, Summer, who am
come to reign over the land.
Mine is the thunder that roars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
over the valley. Hark!...
The echo rolls from the mountains;
the earth rumbles under
my foot: it is Summer coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thunder ceased, but the
rain kept on pouring. And
through the rain spoke Summer&#8217;s
accents; and never had any
heard so soft a voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I, Summer, who am
come to reign over the land.
All that is green shall be greener
still; all that is fair shall be a
thousand-fold fairer. The scent
of the flower shall be sweeter
yet; and the sound of the bird&#8217;s
trill shall be deeper and fuller.
The days shall break earlier in
the East and be lighter and
warmer; the nights shall be cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and still; and there shall be no
end to the joy of the morning
nor to the evening&#8217;s peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Prince of Summer
had spoken, while all things in
the valley bowed and listened
and understood, the thunder
ceased and the rain fell no
longer.</p>

<p>Tall and straight and radiant,
Summer advanced through his
kingdom.</p>

<p>And, wherever he came, the
clouds parted and vanished east
and west behind the hills. The
sky grew clear again and the
drops of water that hung on
every twig and every blade of
grass glistened in the sunlight.
The flowers opened, the birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
came out from under the leafage,
the stag left his cover and
plunged his muzzle into the wet
grass.</p>

<p>But, when the last cloud was
gone and the sun had dried up
the last drop of water and every
single trace of the storm was removed,
nevertheless things were
nowhere the same as they were
before the thunder passed over
the valley.</p>

<p>More flowers came and new
flowers; and their scent was
sweeter and their colour brighter,
even as the Prince of Summer
had said. But it was as though
they had all become more serious.
They no longer swung so
carelessly on their stalks, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
longer scattered their scent so
lavishly to every wind. But,
when a bee or a butterfly came
flitting up, all the flowers
stretched their necks and shed a
redoubled radiance and fragrance
and cried their honey
aloud, so that the insects might
come along and take their pollen-ware.</p>

<p>Nor did the bees themselves
have so good a time as in the
green days of Spring. At
home, in the hive, their queen
was laying eggs by the hundred;
and they had to sweat wax and
build cells and fetch honey and
pollen, till they were nigh dying
with exhaustion. And there
were so many flowers that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
bees did not know where to
turn. In the wood, they got
drunk on the sweet scent of the
linden-blossom and the honeysuckle;
beside the brook, they
fluttered plump into the red cap
of the poppy. Not one of them
was man enough to say no to
those flower-cups: the thistle and
the burdock, the dandelion and
the wild chamomile, all kept
them hard at work. Did they
come to the hedge, the elderberry
called them; would they
rest in the grass, the bindweed
offered them its chalice with
fresh dew-drops on the edge and
honey at the bottom; did they
fly across the lake, the water-lily
lay with her white and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
blossoms and nodded on the silent
waters.</p>

<p>And even as with the flowers
and the bees, so it was everywhere.
Not anywhere were
things as they had been.</p>

<p>However many trills the siskin
struck for his sweetheart, however
fondly he put his head upon
one side, however eagerly he
pecked at her with his beak, she
minded not a jot, but stared
silently and seriously before her:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that nest,&#8221; she said,
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, of course,&#8221; replied
the siskin and looked as though
he had never thought of anything
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it&#8217;s <i>urgent</i>!&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
she. &#8220;We shall have the eggs
before the week is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they found a place
where they felt like building and
together they set to work.</p>

<p>But, wherever they hopped
after a twig for which they had
a use, already other birds were
hopping on the same errand and,
wherever they flew after a
feather in the air, they had to
hurry, lest another should snatch
it first. If he got hold of a
lovely long horsehair, there
would never fail to be some one
pulling at the other end; and, if
she flew out for some nice moss
which she had noticed the day
before, she could be sure that
her fair neighbour had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fetch it that morning. For
every young couple in the wood
was out after furniture and
fittings.</p>

<p>At last, the two siskins got
their house built; and the other
birds did the same. There was
not in the wood a bush so poor
but it carried a nest in its bosom.
In every nest lay eggs; and on
the eggs sat a smart little bird-wife
looking round watchfully
with her black eyes and boring
herself most wretchedly. Every
moment, her husband would
come home with a fly or a worm
or some other good nourishing
food, as he had promised and as
his duty bade him. When evening
came, all the bird-husbands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sat faithfully on the edge of the
nest and sang, each with his little
beak, so touchingly and prettily
that their wives thought it delightful
to be alive.</p>

<p>But up in the tall trees the
crow-wives sat on their eggs;
and on the cliffs the eagles&#8217; consorts
lay brooding.</p>

<p>Everywhere they were busy
preparing for the babies; but not
everywhere was there so pretty
a family-life as in the bushes in
the wood.</p>

<p>True, Mrs. Fox had her hole
deep down in the hillside, where
her youngsters lay as snug as in
their grandmother&#8217;s chest of
drawers. But the timid hare
dropped her young ones in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ditch and had no notion where
their unnatural father was gobbling
his evening cabbage.</p>

<p>And the cuckoo flew round
restlessly and slipped his eggs
stealthily into the others&#8217; nests
and cried most bitterly because
he could never, never build a
home for himself. Nor was the
snail much better off; for she
could do no more than make a
hole in the ground, put her eggs
into it and commend them to
Providence.</p>

<p>The little brown mice had their
parlours full of tiny, blind children,
who could never wish for
kinder or more thoughtful parents.
But Goody Mole, down
in the earth, had to eat her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dirty husband as soon as she had
had her babies, lest <i>he</i> should eat
the little innocents for his lunch.
And the gnat-husbands danced
heedlessly in the evening air,
as though they had nothing better
to do, while their respective
spouses, in great affliction, laid
their eggs in the water.</p>

<p>But the brown frog sat by the
ditch-side and wrung her hands
in speechless horror at the
strange tadpole-children which
she had brought into the world.</p>

<p>And the sun shone and the rain
fell on those who were comfortable
indoors and on those who
had to take things as they came.
Goody Mole worked for two, like
the decent widow that she was;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and the hare suckled her young
so that they might gain strength
quickly and leap away from the
eagle and the fox. The cuckoo
uttered his sorrowful note among
the tall trunks of the forest; and
Mother Gnat let her eggs sail
the pond for themselves, since
that was all that she could do for
them, after which she settled in
the stag&#8217;s ear and helped herself
to a drop of blood to repay her
for her exertions.</p>

<p>But the Prince of Summer
was with them all. He knew of
the smallest gnat and forgot not
a flower in the meadow:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And, every day that passed,
his purple cloak beamed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
golden girdle around his loins
blazed, the red rose in his girdle
glowed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then it happened that a shocking
cry rang out through the forest.
It was so loud that everything
around grew silent and all
listened to hear what it could be.</p>

<p>The one who had uttered the
cry was an old, gnarled oak who
stood among a crowd of fine
young beeches:</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince of Summer, come to
my aid!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see that the beeches are
stifling me? Before you have
made your entry twice more into
the valley, I shall be dead and
buried under their shade.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; said Summer,
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see it?&#8221; cried the oak
and wrung his old branches in
despair. &#8220;You see it and you
don&#8217;t help me? Woe is me, to
have a prince like you! Then
Spring indeed was a different
sort of gracious lord and king.
There was not in the forest a
stick so dry but he readily gave
it a green leaf or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Prince of Summer
looked with indifference at the
old, dying oak:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was never responsible for
Spring&#8217;s green promises,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I reign here according
to my own law, and the law ordains
that you shall die. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
do I want with a fagot like you
in my healthy forests?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned to the beeches
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave you strength to grow.
I give you twofold strength and
tenfold. Hasten and put that
old gentleman to rest!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the beeches shot up aloft
and threw their shade over the
oak till he died.</p>

<p>But there were others besides
the oak that made their complaints
to the Prince of Summer.
Every day and every hour of
the day there was one that threw
up the sponge and shrieked for
help.</p>

<p>There was the grass, which
cried because the stag ate it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;I made your number as the
sand of the sea,&#8221; said the Prince
of Summer. &#8220;I gave you hardiness
and a quick growth; I gave
you the wind to carry your seed
across the meadows. For you I
have done enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there was the stag, who
bellowed because the best grass
was gone. To him the Prince
of Summer said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave you swift legs, so that
you could bound where the grass
is greenest in the forest. If
your legs are tired, then lay you
down to die; and the hind&#8217;s
fawns shall walk in your footsteps.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were the fish in the
river, who ate one another&#8217;s eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and young and then blamed
Summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have me
do?&#8221; asked Summer. &#8220;I gave
you power to lay a thousand
eggs and a thousand more and
a thousand besides. However
many may die, there will always
be fish in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there were the flowers
that sighed because there were
not bees enough to carry off
their pollen. But the Prince of
Summer said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I presented you with honey
to give to the bees for a messenger&#8217;s
fee and taught you to hide
it so that they must take your
pollen into the bargain. I gave
you delicious perfumes and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
colours wherewith to entice
the bees. You call them and
they come; and the one that
promises most and keeps its
promise best is the one they obey
most quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, every time that Summer
spoke, there was a new one that
wailed:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are too few worms!&#8221;
cried the siskin, who now had
four youngsters in the nest and
was wearing himself to a skeleton
in the effort to provide food
for them. &#8220;We are starving.
We can never hold out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are too many birds!&#8221;
whined the worm in the mould.
&#8220;If one but stirs out for a moment,
one is eaten up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Deliver us from the stork!&#8221;
prayed the frogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Provide more frogs,&#8221; cried
the stork, &#8220;or I shall have to go
elsewhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the beech complained because
the cockchafer ate its
leaves; and the crows could never
get cockchafers enough. The
bees whined about the flowers,
as the flowers had done about
the bees: they considered that it
was much too hard to get hold of
the honey. The hare ran away
from the fox and fell into the
talons of the eagle. The young
ash in the hedge raised his voice
to heaven against the honeysuckle
that twined itself right
up to his top.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>But the Prince of Summer
stood tall and straight and radiant
and surveyed his kingdom.
His smile was wide and bright
and there was no pity in his hard
eyes. He raised his hand, as
though to bid them be silent, but
none heeded him; and the noise
increased hourly and the land
was full of cries and lamentations.</p>

<p>Then he knitted his brows and
called the thick black clouds
from behind the hills. They
came at his beck; fear lay over
the valley again; and the cries
were silenced. The thunder
rolled till the mountains shook,
the lightning flamed, the rain
poured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>And Summer&#8217;s great voice
sounded through the air:</p>

<p>&#8220;Know you not that I am a
lord as stern as Winter, whom
you hate? He reigns over death,
as I do over life. I will be
obeyed, like him; like him, I
crush whatever resists me. You
thought I was a minstrel like
Spring, who sang you to life and
longing and went off over the
mountains. But I am greater
than Spring. For I satisfied
your desires with food and made
you subject to the law of life.
But the law is this, that that
which is hale shall stand, but that
which is sick shall fall. Therefore
I made my days long, that
you should become green and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
grow. Therefore I gave you
strength and power in a thousand
ways, the smallest gnat as well as
the tallest tree in the forest, so
that you should fight and grow
up. Therefore I gave you children,
so that you should never
perish. And whoso obeys my
law and well employs the day,
upon him the sunlight of my
eyes shall fall. His strength
shall reign, his children shall
bear his name throughout the
ages. But whoso flinches, he
shall die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince of Summer was
silent and the thunder rolled
away slowly over the mountains.
The clouds parted and vanished;
it became night. The stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
shone bright and friendly, the
trees dripped and all was still.</p>

<p>But, next morning, the valley
awoke to fiercer fighting and
louder cries than ever.</p>

<p>For there was not a bird in
the forest nor a flower in the
meadow but had heard what the
Prince of Summer said and understood
it. They all knew what
it meant and armed themselves,
before sunrise, for the fight for
life.</p>

<p>The siskin and his wife hunted
twice as eagerly in the thicket;
the little brown mice dug twice
as diligently; the flowers redoubled
their radiance and their
fragrance. Goody Mole rummaged
the ground in every direction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the stag found a meadow
where the grass stood high and
green. The beech put forth new
twigs in the place of those which
the cockchafers had eaten; and
the ash stretched its bows right
through the honeysuckle to show
Summer that it was alive.</p>

<p>Thousands died, but none
heard their death-moan, because
of the din that arose from the
fight of the living. And it was
as though more lives came for
each life that was extinguished.</p>

<p>The siskin&#8217;s youngsters hopped
out of the nest and fell from the
branch and fluttered up again.
The crow&#8217;s children screamed in
the tree-tops; the young eagles
flew from the rock to try their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wings. The starling drove her
first brood from the nest and laid
new eggs; the frog lived to
see her degenerate young grow
quite respectable before she herself
was swallowed by the stork.</p>

<p>Never had the fish swarmed so
thickly in the river, never had the
beech&#8217;s leaves been so broad,
never had the copsewood been so
dense, never had the flowers
pressed so close together in the
hedge.</p>

<p>And the Prince of Summer
stood amidst his kingdom taller
and straighter and more radiant
than ever:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then evening came. The
crows flew home from their debating-club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in the old, dead oak;
the little birds in the thicket
sang their evensong in chorus,
but made it short, for they were
very tired. The flowers shut
their petals; the bees closed the
door of their hive. The moth
flew out on her soft, grey wings.
The stars peeped out, ever more
and ever larger.</p>

<p>Carefully, the mist raised its
head and spied and listened.
And, when all was still, it
welled forth, white and grey and
billowy and noiseless. Now it
lay quiet and dreamed, now it
danced its queer dances over
the meads. It peeped into the
wood, where the lime-tree was
shedding its perfume; it glided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
down to the river, which ran and
ran and was swallowed up in the
darkness.</p>

<p>But, suddenly, from the edge
of the wood, a long and jubilant
trill rang out over the valley:</p>

<p class="center">Weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet!</p>

<p>The mist stopped and listened.
The stag raised his head in the
meadow, the birds opened their
sleepy eyes and answered with a
little chirp.</p>

<p class="center">Weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet-a ... weet!</p>

<p>It was the nightingale, who
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smcap">Autumn</span></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><i>The loveliest things of Autumn&#8217;s pack</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>In his mottled coffers lay:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Red mountain-berries,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Hips sweet as cherries,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sloes blue and black</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>He hung upon every spray.</i></div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the top of the hills in the
West stood the Prince of Autumn
and surveyed the land with
his serious eyes.</p>

<p>His hair and beard were
dashed with grey and there were
wrinkles on his forehead. But
he was good to look at still and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
straight and strong. His splendid
cloak gleamed red and green
and brown and yellow and
flapped in the wind. In his
hand he held his horn.</p>

<p>He smiled sadly and stood a
while and listened to the fighting
and the singing and the cries.
Then he raised his head, put the
horn to his mouth and blew a
lusty flourish:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Summer goes his all-prospering way,</div>
<div class="indent">Autumn&#8217;s horn is calling.</div>
<div class="verse">Heather dresses the brown hill-clay,</div>
<div class="verse">Winds whip crackling across the bay,</div>
<div class="indent">Leaves in the grove keep falling.</div>
</div></div>

<p>All the trees of the forest
shook from root to top, themselves
not knowing why. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
birds fell silent together. The
stag in the glade raised his
antlers in surprise and listened.
The poppy&#8217;s scarlet petals flew
before the wind.</p>

<p>But high on the mountains
and on the bare hills and low
down in the bog, the heather
burst forth and blazed purple
and glorious in the sun. And
the bees flew from the faded
flowers of the meadow and hid
themselves in the heather-fields.</p>

<p>But Autumn put his horn to
his mouth again and blew:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Autumn lords it with banners bright</div>
<div class="indent">Of garish leaves held o&#8217;er him,</div>
<div class="verse">Quelling Summer&#8217;s eternal fight,</div>
<div class="verse">Heralding Winter, wild and white,</div>
<div class="indent">While the blithe birds flee before him.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>The Prince of Summer
stopped where he stood in the
valley and raised his eyes to the
hills in the West. And the
Prince of Autumn took the horn
from his mouth and bowed low
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; said Summer.</p>

<p>He took a step towards him
and no more, as befits one who is
the greater. But the Prince
of Autumn came down over the
hills and again bowed low.</p>

<p>They walked through the valley
hand in hand. And so
radiant was Summer that, wherever
they passed, none was
aware of Autumn&#8217;s presence.
The notes of his horn died away
in the air; and one and all recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from the shudder that had
passed over them. The trees
and birds and flowers came to
themselves again and whispered
and sang and fought. The river
flowed, the rushes murmured, the
bees continued their summer
orgy in the heather.</p>

<p>But, wherever the princes
stopped on their progress
through the valley, it came about
that the foliage turned yellow on
the side where Autumn was. A
little leaf fell from its stalk and
fluttered away and dropped at
his feet. The nightingale ceased
singing, though it was eventide;
the cuckoo was silent and flapped
restlessly through the woods; the
stork stretched himself in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
nest and looked towards the
South.</p>

<p>But the princes took no heed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; said Summer
again. &#8220;Do you remember your
promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; answered Autumn.</p>

<p>The Prince of Summer
stopped and looked out over the
kingdom where the noise was
gradually subsiding:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear them?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;They must die and they do not
know it. Now do you take
them into your gentle keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall bring your produce
home,&#8221; said Autumn. &#8220;I shall
watch carefully over them that
dream, I shall cover up lovingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
them that are to sleep in the
mould. I will warn them thrice
of Winter&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said Summer.</p>

<p>They walked in silence for a
time, while night came forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The honeysuckle&#8217;s petals fell
when you blew your horn,&#8221; said
Summer. &#8220;Some of my children
will die at the moment
when I leave the valley. But
the nightingale and the cuckoo
and the stork I shall take with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the two princes walked
in silence. It was quite still;
only the owls hooted in the old
dead oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must send my birds
after me,&#8221; said Summer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;I shall not forget,&#8221; replied
Autumn.</p>

<p>Then the Prince of Summer
raised his hand in farewell and
bade Autumn take possession of
the kingdom:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go to-night,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;And none will know save you.
My splendour will linger in the
valley for a while, so that you
may come more gently to those
to whom you bring death. And
by-and-by, when I am far away
and my reign is forgotten, the
memory of me will revive once
more with the sun and the pleasant
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he strode away in the
night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>But from the high tree-top
came the stork on his long wings;
and the cuckoo fluttered out of
the tall woods; and the nightingale
flew from the thicket with
his full-grown young.</p>

<p>The air was filled with the soft
murmuring of wings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Siskin couple sat and
chatted on the edge of the empty
nest:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember the day
when I courted you?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I had preened and smartened
myself as best I could and you
also looked sweet. The beech
had just come out: I never saw
the wood so green in all my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you sang!&#8221; said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
&#8220;Sing like that again; then perhaps
I will accept you once
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the siskin sadly shook his
head:</p>

<p>&#8220;My voice is gone,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember when we
built the nest?&#8221; she asked, a little
later. &#8220;How snug it was and
how nice! I shall never have so
fine a house again. Just look
how ugly and dilapidated it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The young ones did that,&#8221; he
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but do you remember
the morning when they came
out of the eggs?&#8221; she asked; and
her small black eyes beamed.
&#8220;How sweet they were and how
naked and brown! I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
leave them for a minute but they
screamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then they got their
feathers!&#8221; he said and strutted.
&#8220;Grand siskins, all four of them.
Do you remember the day
they first hopped out of the
nest?&#8221;</p>

<p>She remembered. She remembered
many more things
and reminded him of them all.
And, when there was nothing
left to say, they moved closer to
each other and sat silent; and
each apart thought of the old
days.</p>

<p>And all the others were like
the siskins.</p>

<p>The flowers bent towards one
another and whispered about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
golden time when they stood
with a bee in every chalice. So
eager were they to tell their
stories that none could wait for
the other to finish. All over the
meadow, it sounded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember...?
Do you remember...?&#8221;</p>

<p>The flies and the bees sat for
half the day and idled and talked
intimately and cosily of the beautiful
summer days when they
hummed and buzzed and reigned
in the meadow. The trees waved
their branches softly to one another
and told long stories of
their green youth. The rushes
put their brown tips together and
dreamt the whole thing over
again. The little brown mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sat in the hedge, in the evening
sun, and told the children the
story of their courtship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember...?
Do you remember...?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of the valley
stood the Prince of Autumn,
with his horn in his hand. But
none saw him.</p>

<p>Then the crow flew out of the
wood on flapping wings and
screamed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Past! Past! How can you
care to talk of those old things?
It&#8217;s all past! Past! Past!&#8221;</p>

<p>Echo sang from the hills:</p>

<p>&#8220;Past! Past! Past!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Echo whispered in the
rushes and hummed in the river
and sounded in all that lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the land. They all then and
there understood that summer
was over. They stopped in the
middle of their stories and listened
and chimed in:</p>

<p>&#8220;Past! Past! Past!&#8221;</p>

<p>And suddenly they all saw the
Prince of Autumn, as he stood
there in the midst of them, in his
motley cloak. They stared at
him with frightened eyes and at
one another.</p>

<p>But he put his horn to his
mouth and blew till it rang over
the valley:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Autumn&#8217;s horn blew a lusty chime,</div>
<div class="verse">For the first time, for the first time!</div>
<div class="indent">Interpret well its warning:</div>
<div class="verse">September night,</div>
<div class="verse">Breed mushrooms white,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Lay midge in mould,</div>
<div class="verse">Plait bronze with gold</div>
<div class="indent">For green tree-tops&#8217; adorning.</div>
</div></div>

<p>He looked over the valley with
his serious eyes. But, when the
last echo of the notes had died
away, he spread his motley cloak
in the sun and laughed and
nodded.</p>

<p>And, while the sky was higher
than it had ever been and the air
mild and the lake blue and the
mountains stood out clear on the
horizon, the land passed dutifully
under Autumn&#8217;s dominion.</p>

<p>It had indeed begun on the
night when Summer went away,
with a yellow leaf here and a
brown leaf there, but none had
noticed it. Now it went at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
quicker pace; and, as time wore
on, there came ever more colours
and greater splendour.</p>

<p>The lime-trees turned bright
yellow and the beech bronze, but
the elder-tree even blacker than it
had been. The bell-flower rang
with white bells, where it used
to ring with blue, and the chestnut-tree
blessed all the world
with its five yellow fingers. The
mountain-ash shed its leaves that
all might admire its pretty berries;
the wild rose nodded with
a hundred hips; the Virginia
creeper broke over the hedge in
blazing flames.</p>

<p>The moss grew soft and green;
and the toadstools shot up in the
night. Queer, soft, pale creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
they were and poisonous
and envious they looked. But
some of them had a scarlet hat on
and all were overjoyed with life.</p>

<p>But the siskin could find no
flies and was wailing pitifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go away!&#8221; said the
Prince of Autumn. &#8220;Your time
is over; and I have plenty of
birds left.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away flew siskin and linnet
and many with them. But Autumn
put his horn to his mouth
and blew:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The loveliest things of Autumn&#8217;s pack</div>
<div class="indent">In his motley coffers lay:</div>
<div class="verse">Red mountain-berries,</div>
<div class="verse">Hips sweet as cherries,</div>
<div class="verse">Sloes blue and black,</div>
<div class="indent">He hung upon every spray.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>And blackbird and thrush
chattered blithely in the copsewood,
which gleamed with berries,
and a thousand sparrows
kept them company.</p>

<p>At night, it was quite still.
The stag went into the meadow
with noiseless steps and lifted his
antlers and reconnoitred. The
bird sat and slept somewhere
with his head under his wing;
the wind dared hardly whisper
among the faded foliage. The
stars twinkled far and peacefully.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then the leaves fell.</p>

<p>And, as they broke from the
branches and whirled through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the air and fell to the ground,
they sighed softly and filled the
forest with strange, plaintive
sounds. But none could hear
them who had not seen his own
hopes die.</p>

<p>But, next morning, those
which were left gleamed brighter
still and spread themselves
and laughed in the sun, as if they
had never amused themselves so
well. The birch stood flirting on
the moor; and the tiny little
plants in the hedge sported their
red leaves. The beech and the
oak changed one thing or another
in their dress each day, till they
became more fantastic than ever.
The falling leaves flew from tree
to tree and remained lying there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
till the whole at last became
one great confusion.</p>

<p>But redder than the reddest
blazed the Virginia creeper; and
the crows made such a din every
evening in the old, dead oak that
you could not hear yourself
speak. The thrushes chattered,
the sparrows screamed, the wind
ran from one to the other and
puffed and panted to add to the
fun. High up in the sky, the
sun looked gently down upon it
all.</p>

<p>And the Prince of Autumn
nodded contentedly and let his
motley cloak flap in the wind:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the least important of
the four seasons and am scarcely
lord in my own land,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
&#8220;I serve two jealous masters and
have to please them both. But
my power extends so far, that I
can give you a few glad days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he put his horn to his
mouth and blew:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To the valley revellers hie!</div>
<div class="indent">They are clad in autumnal fancy-dresses,</div>

<div class="indent">Hey fol-de-rol-day for Autumn!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The beech wears a coat of red,</div>
<div class="indent">The oak grows feeble, his strength is shaken,</div>
<div class="indent">Summer&#8217;s fine birds the Devil has taken!</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The birch that was ever shy.</div>
<div class="indent">Stands&mdash;look!&mdash;in her yellow smock unbidden,</div>
<div class="indent">With scarcely a white, lank limb that&#8217;s hidden!</div>
<div class="verse">Green pines straddle towards the sky&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">Hey fol-re-rol-day for Autumn!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, just as the gaiety was at
its height and the land full of
noise, exactly as in the fairest
days of summer ... there were
two that mistook the time of
year!</p>

<p>It was the cherry-tree for one
and the strawberry-plant for
another.</p>

<p>They felt the sun shining so
very warm and saw how everything
rejoiced. Then they forgot
themselves and burst forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
anew. Carefully, they opened
their white flowers and shivered
at once, for it was colder than
they had thought.</p>

<p>And, when the dainty white
blossoms spread in the morning
sun, all the motley trees of the
wood laughed them to scorn.
The crows fell off the branches
with laughter, the sparrows
shrieked: one and all considered
it the best notion they had ever
seen. But a belated bee opened
six thousand great eyes and had
an apoplectic fit, because she
thought she had taken leave of
her senses.</p>

<p>The Prince of Autumn
looked at the flowers with moist
eyes and shook his head:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&#8220;You poor little ninnies!&#8221; he
said, sadly.</p>

<p>But the Virginia creeper
flung her warm red arms around
them and said that they were
sweet.</p>

<p>The blossoms thrived and
grew; and one of them even
put forth a tiny green berry.
And, when the others saw that,
they gave up laughing and began
to think about it. The
alder looked itself up and down
and reflected that it still was
quite green; and the birch was
nearly sinking into the ground
for shame at its nakedness.
The old frog suddenly said,
&#8220;Quack!&#8221; and was so startled at
this that she plunged head foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to the bottom of the lake.
The sparrow suddenly felt lonely
and looked round fondly
among the daughters of the
land.</p>

<p>But the beech shook up a heap
of brown leaves and clung convulsively
to those which were
green:</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>may</i> be possible,&#8221; it said
to itself and, then and there,
put out three new shoots.</p>

<p>But, the night after this happened,
there was a tremendous
disturbance up on the mountain-peaks,
where the eternal snows
had lain both in Spring&#8217;s time
and Summer&#8217;s. It sounded like
a storm approaching. The trees
grew frightened, the crows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
silent, the wind held its breath.</p>

<p>The Prince of Autumn bent
forward and listened:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the worst you can
do?&#8221; shouted a hoarse voice
through the darkness.</p>

<p>Autumn raised his head and
looked straight into Winter&#8217;s
great, cold eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten the bargain?&#8221;
asked Winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Autumn. &#8220;I
have not forgotten it. But, if
they must die, at least give them
leave to dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care!&#8221; shouted Winter.</p>

<p>The whole night through, it
rumbled and tumbled in the
mountains. It turned so bitterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cold that the starling thought
seriously of packing up; and
even the red creeper turned pale.
When the sun rose, the cherry-blossoms
and strawberry-blossoms
hung dead upon their
stalks.</p>

<p>The distant peaks glittered
with new snow.</p>

<p>And the Prince of Autumn
laughed no more. He looked
out earnestly over the land and
the wrinkles in his forehead grew
deeper:</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be so then!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then he blew his horn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Autumn&#8217;s horn blew a lusty chime;</div>
<div class="verse">For the second time, for the second time!</div>
<div class="indent">Heed well the call, complying:</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Fling seed to earth!</div>
<div class="verse">Fill sack&#8217;s full girth!</div>
<div class="verse">Plump back and side!</div>
<div class="verse">Pad belt and hide!</div>
<div class="indent">Hold all wings close for flying!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then suddenly a terrible
bustle arose in the land. For
now they all understood that
fortune was on the ebb; and all
thought that there was something
they had forgotten or
something they were not ready
with.</p>

<p>Round about the thicket, the
bushes shouted aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Buy my hips! Who&#8217;ll buy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Service-berries! Service-berries!
Fine red service-berries!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackberries! Fresh blackberries!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;Sloes! Sloes! Sloes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the thrush and the blackbird
swept down upon them and
gorged themselves with the good
berries till they were well provided
for their journey. The
sparrows ate all they could get
down; the crows drove the others
away and guzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; said Autumn. &#8220;Remove
that finery!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poppy and the bell-flower
and the pink stood thin
and dry as sticks, with their
heads full of seed. The dandelion
had presented each one of
his seeds with a sweet little parachute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear Wind, and shake
us!&#8221; said the poppy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&#8220;Fly away with my seeds,
Wind!&#8221; said the dandelion.</p>

<p>And the wind hastened to do
as they asked.</p>

<p>But the beech cunningly
dropped his shaggy fruit on to
the hare&#8217;s fur; and the fox got
one also on <i>his</i> red coat. Thus
they carried the beech&#8217;s children
out into the world without having
the least suspicion what they
were doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, now!&#8221; said Autumn.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no time here to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little brown mice filled
their parlours from floor to ceiling
with nuts and beech-mast
and acorns. The hedgehog had
already eaten himself so fat that
he could hardly lower his quills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
but still loitered around all night
to get more food. The hare and
the fox and the stag put on clean
white woollen things under their
coats. The starling and the
thrush and the blackbird saw to
their downy clothing and exercised
their wings for the long
journey. The sparrows were
envious that they could not go
too; as for the crows, nothing
seemed to hurt them; and the
lapwing sat on his tussock and
looked lonely.</p>

<p>But the bat went right away
and hung himself on his own
hindlegs deep down in a hollow
tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; said Autumn. &#8220;It
will be over in a week.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>The sun hid himself behind
the clouds and did not appear
for many days.</p>

<p>It began to rain. The wind
quickened its pace: it dashed the
rain over the meadow, whipped
the river into foam and whistled
uncannily through the trunks in
the forest. The leaves fell without
ceasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the song is finished!&#8221;
said the Prince of Autumn.</p>

<p>Then he put his horn to his
mouth and blew:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Autumn&#8217;s horn blew a lusty chime,</div>
<div class="verse">For the last time, for the last time!</div>
<div class="indent">Ways close when need is sorest:</div>
<div class="verse">Land-birds, fly clear!</div>
<div class="verse">Plunge, frogs, in mere!</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Bee, lock your lair!</div>
<div class="verse">Take shelter, bear!</div>
<div class="indent">Fall, last leaf in the forest!</div>
</div></div>

<p>And then it was over.</p>

<p>It all went at such a rate that
one could hardly tell how it began
or how it ended.</p>

<p>The birds flew from the land
in flocks. The starling and
the lapwing, the thrush and the
blackbird all migrated to the
South. Every night, the sparrow
heard their chirping and the
fluttering of their wings in the
air.</p>

<p>Every morning, before the
sun rose, the wind tore through
the forest and pulled the last
leaves off the trees. Every day,
the wind blew stronger, snapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
great branches, swept the withered
leaves together into heaps,
scattered them again and, at
last, laid them like a soft, thick
carpet over the whole floor of the
forest. Here and there, a single
leaf hung on a twig and resisted
and refused to die. But this
was only a short respite, for, if
it did not fall to-day, it fell to-morrow.</p>

<p>The hedgehog crawled so far
into a hole under a heap of
stones that he remained caught
between two of them and could
move neither forwards nor backwards.
The sparrow took lodgings
in a deserted swallow&#8217;s-nest;
the frogs went to the bottom of
the pond for good, settled in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mud, with the tips of their noses
up in the water, and prepared
for whatever might come. The
waves loosened the water-lily&#8217;s
stalks and washed them clean
away; the rushes snapped in the
storm and drifted with the
stream.</p>

<p>The Prince of Autumn stood
and gazed over the land to see if
it was bare and waste, so that
Winter&#8217;s storms might come
buffeting at will and the snow
lie where it pleased.</p>

<p>And so empty was it that the
sun rose later, morning after
morning, and went earlier to bed,
evening after evening, because
he did not think that he had anything
to shine upon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; roared
Winter from the mountains.
&#8220;My clouds are bursting with
snow; and my storms are breaking
loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have one day left,&#8221; said
Autumn.</p>

<p>He walked across the meadow,
where already the grass was yellow
and the flowers gone, except
the little white daisy, which can
never get done in time. Then he
went into the naked wood. He
peeped at the hedgehog, smiled
at the little brown mice, who
carried the shells neatly and decently
outside the parlour each
time they had had a nut-feast,
patted the strong beech-trunks
and asked them if they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
stand the storm and nodded to
the jolly crows.</p>

<p>Then he stopped before the
old, dead oak and looked at the
ivy that clambered right up to
the top and spread her green
leaves as if Winter had no existence
at all.</p>

<p>And, while he looked at it with
eyes that were gentle and moist
like Spring&#8217;s, the ivy-flowers
blossomed. They sat right at
the top and rocked in the wind,
yellow-green and insignificant,
but just as good flowers as any
of those which grew in Summer&#8217;s
kingdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I can restrain my
storms no longer!&#8221; roared Winter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>The Prince of Autumn bent
his head and listened. He could
hear the storm come rushing
down over the mountains. A
snowflake fell upon his motley
cloak ... and another ...
and yet another....</p>

<p>For the last time, he put his
horn to his mouth and blew in
sad and subdued tones:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thou greenest plant and tardiest,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou fairest, rarest, hardiest,</div>

<div class="verse">Thy vigorous embraces cling.</div>
<div class="verse">Look! Ivy mine, &#8217;tis <i>I</i> who sing,</div>
<div class="indent">&#8217;Tis <i>Autumn</i> wins thy flowers!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then he went away in the
storm.</p>

CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smcap">Winter</span></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Wee snow-birds, white snow-birds,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>White snow-birds, wee snow-birds,</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Through fields skim along!</i></div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Winter</span> was on the mountains,
but his face was hidden by thick
clouds that lay in wait, ready to
burst and let loose all the evil
that was in them.</p>

<p>Now and again, the clouds
parted a little. But that was
only for a moment; and, when it
happened, the snow-clad peaks
glittered in the sun till you could
look at nothing else and could
hardly bear to look at them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
And, even when the storm flew
wildest over the valley and the
river foamed and the trees
cracked and broke and fell, even
then the clouds lay thick and
close before the face of Winter.</p>

<p>Sometimes, some of them dissolved
into mists, which swept
down upon the valley and filled
it quite. But they were different
mists from those which
Spring laid over the land. No
violets came from <i>them</i>; in <i>their</i>
lap were no crops and no longing
and no life. They were as
cold as if there were no sun at
all behind them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it rained, in a
dense and endless downpour,
day after day. The blast dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the rain into the eyes of the
hare and the stag, till they had
to hide where best they could
and turn their tails to the wind.
The little brown mice could
hardly put their noses outside
their door; and the sparrows sat
rumpled and disconsolate under
the leafless bushes. But the
crows rocked undaunted on the
tallest twigs and held their beaks
straight to the wind, so that it
should not blow up under their
feathers.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it snowed as well.
But it was a stupid, sluggish
snow, which melted the moment
that it touched the ground.</p>

<p>At night, the wind hooted in
the mountain-clefts and the owl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in the wood. The withered
leaves ran round and rustled
like ghosts. The boughs of the
trees swayed sadly to and fro, to
and fro.</p>

<p>And, whether it snowed or
rained or only misted, whether
it were day or night, the valley
lay ever in a horrid sludge and
just as many clouds hung lurking
in the mountains. The
withered blades of grass eddied
hopelessly in the meadow. The
waves flowed bleak and cold in
the river.</p>

<p>Then, one night, it froze.</p>

<p>The slush on the ground
hardened into a thin crust, which
the stag stuck his hoof through,
but the hare ran safely across it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The hedgehog shivered in his
dreams, the ivy-flowers faded,
the puddles got ice upon them.</p>

<p>And, next morning early, a
thin layer of snow fell over the
land. The sun shone again, but
far and cold; and the clouds
drifted away.</p>

<p>The Prince of Winter sat on
the mountains: an old man, with
white hair and beard. His
naked breast was shaggy,
shaggy his legs and hands. He
looked strong and wild, with
cold stern eyes.</p>

<p>But he was not angry, as
when Spring drove him from the
valley and when Autumn did
not go quickly enough. He
looked out over the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
calmly, for now he knew that it
was his. And, when he found
anything dead or empty or desolate,
he plucked at his great
white beard and gave a harsh and
satisfied laugh.</p>

<p>But all that lived in the land
was struck with terror when it
looked into his cold eyes.</p>

<p>The trees shook in their thick
bark and the bushes struck their
branches together in consternation.
The mouse became quite
snow-blind, when she peeped
outside the door; the stag looked
mournfully over the white
meadow:</p>

<p>&#8220;My muzzle can still break
through the ice, when I drink,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I can still scrape the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
snow to one side and find a tuft
of grass. But, if things go on
like this for another week, then
it&#8217;s all up with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crows and the chaffinch
and the sparrow and the tit had
quite lost their voices. They
thought of the other birds, who
had departed in time, and knew
not where to turn in their distress.
At last, they set out in a
row to carry their humble greeting
to the new lord of the land:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here come your birds, O
mightiest of all princes!&#8221; said
the crow and stood and marked
time in the white snow. &#8220;The
others left the country as soon
as you announced your coming,
but we have remained to submit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
us to your sway. Now be a gracious
lord to us and grant us
food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We bow before Your Highness!&#8221;
said the chaffinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have so longed for you!&#8221;
said the tit and put his head on
one side.</p>

<p>And the sparrow said the
same as the others, in a tone of
deep respect.</p>

<p>But the Prince of Winter
laughed at them disdainfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, you time-serving birds!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Now you fawn upon
<i>me</i>. In Summer&#8217;s time, you
amused yourselves merrily; in
Autumn&#8217;s you ate yourselves
stout and fat; and, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Spring strikes up, you will dance
to his piping like the others. I
hate you and your screaming
and squalling and the trees you
hop about in. You are all here
to defy me; and I shall do for
you if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he rose in all his
strength:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my own birds and now
you shall see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He clapped his hands and
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Wee snow-birds, white snow-birds,</div>
<div class="verse">White snow-birds, wee snow-birds,</div>
<div class="indent">Through fields skim along!</div>
<div class="verse">To jubilant Spring I grudge music of no birds,</div>
<div class="indent">To Summer no song.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Come, Winter&#8217;s mute messengers, swift birds and slow birds,</div>
<div class="verse">White snow-birds, wee snow-birds,</div>
<div class="indent">Till the valley be soft as down for your nesting</div>
<div class="verse">Of numberless ice-eggs by frosty rims spanned!</div>
<div class="indent">Now rushing, now resting,</div>
<div class="verse">White snow-birds, wee snow-birds,</div>
<div class="verse">Skim soft through the land!</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Winter&#8217;s birds came.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it darkened and the
air became full of little black
specks, which descended and
turned into great white snowflakes.
They fell over the
ground, more and more, in an
endless multitude; all white and
silent, they lay side by side and
layer upon layer. The carpet
over the land grew ever thicker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>The crows and the others took
shelter in the forest, while the
snow fell, and gazed dejectedly
over the valley. There was now
not a blade of grass, nor yet a
stone to be seen: everything was
smooth and soft and white. Only
the trees stood out high in the
air; and the river flowed through
the meadow, black with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how to crush <i>you</i>!&#8221;
said the Prince of Winter.</p>

<p>And, when evening came, he
told the wind to go down.
Then the waves became small
and still, Winter stared at them
with his cold eyes and the ice
built its bridge from bank to
bank. In vain the waves tried
to hum Spring&#8217;s song. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was no strength in their voices.
In vain they called upon Summer&#8217;s
sun and Autumn&#8217;s cool
breezes. There was none that
heard their complaint; and they
had to submit to the yoke.</p>

<p>Next morning, there was
nothing left of the river but a
narrow channel; and, when one
more night had passed, the
bridge was finished. Again the
Prince of Winter called for his
white birds; and soon the carpet
was drawn over the river, till it
was no longer possible to see
where land began and water
ended.</p>

<p>But the trees strutted ever so
boldly out of the deep snow; and
the crows screamed in their tops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
The firs and pines had kept all
their leaves and were so green
that it was quite shocking to behold.
Wherever they stood,
they acted as a protection
against the frost and a shelter
against the snow; and the chaffinch
and the other small birds
found a hospitable refuge under
their roofs.</p>

<p>The Prince of Winter looked
at them angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could but cow you, if I
could but break you!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You defy me and you irritate
me. You stand in the midst of
my kingdom keeping guard for
Summer and you give shelter to
the confounded screechers and
screamers who disturb the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of my land. My ice cannot
penetrate to your pith and kill
you. If I had only snow
enough to bury you, so that, at
least, you did not offend my
eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the trees stood strong under
Winter&#8217;s wrath and waved
their long branches:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have taken from us
what you can,&#8221; they said.
&#8220;Farther than that your power
does not go. We will wait
calmly for better times.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had said this,
Winter suddenly set eyes upon
tiny little buds round about the
twigs. He saw the walnut&#8217;s
spikes, that smacked of spring.
He saw the little brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
mice trip out for a run in the
snow and disappear again into
their snug parlours before his
eyes. He distinctly heard the
hedgehog snoring in the hedge;
and the crows kept on screaming
in his ears. Through his own
ice, he saw the noses of the frogs
stick up from the bottom of the
pond.</p>

<p>He was seized with frenzy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I dream or am I awake?&#8221;
he shouted and tore at his beard
with both hands. &#8220;Are they
making a fool of me? Am I the
master or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard the anemones
breathe peacefully and lightly
in the mould, he heard thousands
of grubs bore deep into the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the trees as cheerfully and imperturbably
as though Summer
were in the land. He saw the
bees crawl about in their busy
hive and share the honey they
had collected in summer and
have a happy time. He saw the
bat in the hollow tree, the worm
deep down in the ground; and,
wherever he turned, he saw millions
of eggs and grubs and
chrysalids, well guarded and
waiting confidently for him to
go away.</p>

<p>Then he leapt down into the
valley and raised his clenched
fists to heaven. His white hair
and beard streamed in the wind,
his lips trembled, his eyes glittered
like ice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>He stamped on the ground
and sang in his loud, hoarse voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Roar forth, mine anger, roar and rouse</div>
<div class="indent">What breathes below earth&#8217;s girder!</div>
<div class="verse">By thousands slay them&mdash;bird and mouse,</div>
<div class="verse">And fish and frog and leaf and louse!</div>
<div class="verse">In deadly fog the valley souse!</div>
<div class="verse">Build me a royal pleasure-house</div>
<div class="verse">Of ice and snow, where storms carouse</div>
<div class="indent">With Death and Cold and Murder!</div>
</div></div>

<p>He shouted it over the land.</p>

<p>The ice broke and split into
long cracks. It sounded like
thunder from the bottom of the
river. It darkened, as when
Summer&#8217;s thunder-storms used
to gather over the valley, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
worse still, for then you could
perceive that it would all pass
by, but now there was no hope to
be seen.</p>

<p>Then the storm broke loose.</p>

<p>The gale roared so that you
could hear the trees fall crashing
in the forest. The ice was split
in two and the huge floes heaped
up into towering icebergs, while
the water froze together again
at once. The frost bit as deep
into the ground as it could go
and bit to death every living
thing that it found in the mould.
The snow fell and drifted over
meadow and hill; sky and earth
were blended into one.</p>

<p>This lasted for many days;
and those were hard times.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>The sparrows did not know at
last if they were alive or dead;
the crows crept into the pine-forest,
silent with hunger and
fear. The stag had not found
a single tuft of grass for two
days past and now leapt belling
through the wood, tortured with
starvation. The mice crept together
in their parlours and
froze; the chaffinch froze to
death; the hare lay dead in the
meadow; the fox ate the hare&#8217;s
remains and was very thankful
to do so.</p>

<p>And, when the weather subsided
at last, things were not a
whit better.</p>

<p>It was more piercingly cold
than ever. The snow lay all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
around in huge drifts; and,
where the snow had been blown
away, the ground was hard as
stone. Every single puddle
was frozen to the bottom; the
lake was frozen, the river was
frozen; and the stag had to swallow
snow to slake his thirst.</p>

<p>Want reigned on every side.</p>

<p>The hedgehog had shrunk until
there was room for two in the
hole which was once too small
for him. The crows fought like
mad, if they found as much as an
old shrivelled berry forgotten in
the bushes. The fox skulked
about with an empty stomach
and evil eyes. But the little
brown mice discovered with dismay
that they were nearly come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to the bottom of their store-room,
for they had eaten very hard to
keep warm in the bad days.</p>

<p>The Prince of Winter stood
in the valley and looked upon all
this with content. He went into
the forest, where the snow was
frozen to windward right up to
the tops of the smooth beech-trunks;
but on the boughs of the
fir-trees it lay so thick that they
were weighed right down to the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be Summer&#8217;s servants,&#8221;
he said, scornfully, &#8220;but
still you have to resign yourselves
to wearing my livery.
And now the sun shall shine on
you; and I will have a glorious
day after my own heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>He bade the sun come out; and
he came.</p>

<p>He rode over a bright blue
sky; and all that was still alive
in the valley raised itself towards
him and looked to him for
warmth. There was a yearning
and a sighing deep in the
ground and deep in the forest
and deep in the river:</p>

<p>&#8220;Call Spring back to the valley!
Give us Summer again!
We are yearning! We are
yearning!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sun had but a cold
smile in answer to their prayers.
He gleamed upon the hoar-frost,
but could not melt it; he stared
down at the snow, but could not
thaw it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>The valley lay dead and silent
under its white winding-sheet.
Scarcely even the crows
screamed in the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I like to see the
land,&#8221; said Winter.</p>

<p>And the day came to an end,
a short, sorry day, swallowed up
helplessly in the great, stern
night, in which a thousand stars
shone cold over the earth. The
snow creaked under the tread of
the stag; the sparrow chirped
with hunger in his sleep. The
ice thundered and split into huge
cracks.</p>

<p>The Prince of Winter sat on
his mountain throne again and
surveyed his kingdom and was
glad. His great, cold eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stared, while he growled in his
beard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indent">And yet fewer flowers.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The days wore on and Winter
reigned over the land.</p>

<p>The little brown mice had
eaten their last nut and were at
their wits&#8217; end as to the future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The hedgehog was reduced to
skin and bone; the crows were
nearly giving in. The river lay
dead under the ice.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there came the
sound of singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Play up! Play soon!</div>
<div class="verse">Keep time! Keep tune!</div>

<div class="verse">Burst ice and rime</div>
<div class="indent">In equinoctial splendour!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Up leapt Winter and stared
with his hand over his brows.</p>

<p>Down below in the valley
stood the Prince of Spring,
young and straight, in his green
garb, with the lute slung over his
shoulder. His long hair waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in the wind, his face was soft and
round, his mouth was ever smiling,
his eyes were dreamy and
moist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A hundred</span> thousand years
passed, one like the other, and
the day came when the princes
were to meet again, as arranged,
and to hear from one another
how things had gone.</p>

<p>They went to the meeting-place
in the darkness of the
night and sat down separately
where they had sat before, in a
circle, each on his mountain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
When the sun rose, he shone
upon the four great lords in all
their might and splendour.</p>

<p>And Summer&#8217;s purple cloak
beamed and the golden belt
round his loins and the rose in
his belt. Spring sat in his green
garb and plucked at the strings
of his lute and hummed to it.
Autumn&#8217;s motley cloak flapped
in the wind. The snow on Winter&#8217;s
mountain sparkled like diamonds.</p>

<p>Summer&#8217;s eyes and Winter&#8217;s
met for the first time after
many years. The sweat sprang
to Winter&#8217;s brow; Summer shivered
and wrapped himself in his
cloak. They were both equally
strong and equally proud; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
eyes of the one were as gentle as
the other&#8217;s were cold and stern.
They looked angrily at each
other, bitter, irreconcilable enemies
as before.</p>

<p>And Spring and Autumn sat
just opposite each other, as on
that day long since; and their
eyes met like Winter&#8217;s and Summer&#8217;s,
for they neither had seen
each other during the years that
passed. And Spring&#8217;s glance
was just as moist and dreamy
and young and Autumn&#8217;s just
as sad and serious.</p>

<p>The princes sat like that for a
while. Then they all rose and
bowed low, but Spring and Autumn
bowed lower than the
others, as befits those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the lesser. And, when they
were seated again, each on his
mountain, Autumn turned his
serious eyes to Summer and
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I keep the covenant we
made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you did,&#8221; said Summer.
&#8220;You brought my produce
home; I thank you for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Autumn turned to Winter
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;And did I do what I promised
you? Did I make your
bed? Did I make room on the
earth for your storms and your
frost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; replied Winter,
bluntly. &#8220;But you always left
the valley too late.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>Spring raised his young face
towards the Prince of Summer
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I spread your cloth as
I promised? Did I release the
water from the yoke of the ice,
did I rid the earth of its frozen
crust? Did I drape the green
woods for your coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did,&#8221; replied Summer,
kindly. &#8220;And I owe you
my thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Winter shook his fist at
green Spring and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;You always came too soon,
you rascal! I never got my
snows thoroughly emptied, my
storms had never blown themselves
out, before you were
there with your hurdy-gurdy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8220;I did as I had to,&#8221; replied
Spring and smiled and plucked
at the strings of his lute.</p>

<p>But the Prince of Autumn
rose and made three deep bows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then our meeting was fortunate
for the poor earth,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Now we can part, never
to meet again, and go our way
over the land until the end of
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince of Spring rose
and bowed three times, as Autumn
had done, and bound the
lute over his shoulder. But
Summer and Winter remained
sitting and looked out before
them, as if they had more on
their minds; and, when Spring
and Autumn saw this, they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
down again, each on his mountain,
and waited respectfully.</p>

<p>And, when this had lasted
some time, Winter raised his
white head and looked from the
one to the other. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I will say what we are
all thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Autumn turned a questioning
glance towards him; and Spring
unfastened his lute again and
played and hummed. But the
Prince of Summer nodded in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are princes by the grace
of God,&#8221; said Winter. &#8220;We
have shared the earth among us
by turns, according to agreement,
so that each of us reigned
for a quarter of the year. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
have kept the covenant which we
made with one another, but the
land is no longer ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are no longer lords in
the land,&#8221; said Winter. &#8220;Men
have seized upon the power.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince of Summer
nodded once more; Autumn just
bowed his head in assent; and
Spring hummed his songs and
looked out over the land as if he
were not even listening. But
Winter continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not whence they
came. I daresay they are some
of that vermin which Spring
lures up from the mould with
his playing and which Summer
keeps the life in. I do not know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
But this I do know, that they
are there, swarming over the
land and increasing year by
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Summer.</p>

<p>The Prince of Autumn
nodded his head, but Spring
went on playing and humming.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is how the matter
stands,&#8221; said Winter. &#8220;And I
cannot touch them. They are
too clever for me and they become
more clever each time I see
them anew. In vain I send my
most piercing colds, my mightiest
storms against them. They
have built houses in which they
sit snug and safe and allow the
storms to rage. They light fires
to keep themselves warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
have made themselves thick
woollen clothes for their bodies
and limbs, their hands and feet.
And even <i>that</i> is not enough.
The animals they have a use
for they take into their houses;
the bushes they want to protect
they bind up in mats and
straw. When I send my snow
down over the earth, till it
lies right up to the roofs of their
houses, they shovel it away and
make roads and paths right
through it. When I bind the
water with ice, they break the ice
into pieces, if <i>that</i> suits them, or
else they put iron under their
feet and skate over the ice and
derive a pleasure from it into the
bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Summer.
&#8220;Men have seized upon the
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Prince of Winter was
not yet done with his grievance:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is men that rule the earth,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;And they know it and
tease and hinder me everywhere.
To show their thorough contempt
for me, they have placed
their greatest and most important
festival in the very midst of
my reign. So brazen are they
that they simply beg me for ice
and snow for their &#8216;Christmas&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know them too,&#8221; said the
Prince of Autumn. &#8220;I cannot
deny that they have made themselves
lords of the earth, even
though they do me no particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
harm. But they are self-willed
and they bring the crops home
sometimes earlier and sometimes
later than is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so!&#8221; shouted Winter.
&#8220;That is why I cannot starve
them to death, because they fill
their barns in Autumn&#8217;s time.
If we kept together, we could
crush them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now Summer raised his
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Men have the power,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and we can do nothing to
prevent it. They have become
too many for us and too clever,
as Winter has said. In the beginning,
I had nothing against
them. They ran in the forest
like my other creatures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
hunted and fought and bore
their children under the foliage.
They obeyed the law of life, as I
had laid it down, and I granted
that to them just as much as to
the stag and the sparrow and
the worm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first time they saw me
they wrapped themselves in
skins and hid themselves in
holes,&#8221; said Winter, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was their right,&#8221; replied
Summer, calmly. &#8220;Every
single being that I have created
seeks protection against your
wickedness, if he cannot fly the
land during your reign. But
men are no longer what they
were. They no longer hunt
freely and bravely in the wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Their colour has become pale,
their arms weak, their hearts
craven. For years at a time,
their children are feeble and
helpless. Men are wretched
creatures that deserve to die;
and I would not say a word
against it if Winter killed them
all. For they do not reign because
they are the strongest, but
because they have studied all the
world&#8217;s subtle contrivances and
devices. That is what gives
them their power upon earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us extirpate them!&#8221;
roared Winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot do that,&#8221; replied
the Prince of Summer. &#8220;They
have adapted the earth entirely
to suit their own needs. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have exterminated some of my
animals and plants, because these
were of no use nor pleasure to
them; others they have disseminated
everywhere. And all that
they take into their service become
weak and sickly like unto
themselves, tied to them and dependent
upon them, so that they
can yield them the advantages
which they need, but are no
longer allowed to lead the free
life for which they were created.
I hate men, as the Prince
of Winter hates them. But
there is no remedy against their
might.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceased speaking. The
three princes stared despondently
before them. But Spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
plucked gaily at the strings of
his lute.</p>

<p>Then Winter turned to him
and said, roughly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the only one that
has not spoken. What harm do
men do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us!&#8221; demanded Autumn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hate them as we do?&#8221;
asked Summer.</p>

<p>The Prince of Spring raised
his young face and looked at
them as though his thoughts
were far away. Then he said:
&#8220;Men? They cause me no pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is one of your
green lies,&#8221; sneered Winter.</p>

<p>But Spring looked away before
him with his moist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
dreamy eyes, plucked harder at
the strings and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;See, when I come to the valley
and touch the strings of my
lute and sing to it and the flowers
spring up from the mould:
then the wailing relaxes in men&#8217;s
hearts even as in the cold ground.
Then they sing and flourish and
thrive and laugh; and love is
kindled in their thoughts; and
their souls rejoice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three looked at Spring in
amazement, but he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was an old, old man,
when last I came to the valley.
His hair was white and his eyes
dim. His hands groped helplessly
before him; and his legs
could scarcely bear him. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
daughter died in Summer&#8217;s passionate
hours; his sons dropped
dead while gathering Autumn&#8217;s
crops. His wife closed her eyes
under your wrath, O mighty
Winter! But, when I stood in
the valley and plucked at the
strings of my lute, suddenly he
straightened his crooked back
and his eyes recovered their fire:
&#8216;The woods are turning green!&#8217;
he said. And he went out and
ran on his shaking legs after my
flowers and listened to my song
and joined with the others in my
green gladness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceased. Not one of the
three princes answered him.
Long they sat silent and looked
out over the earth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>And evening fell and night.
The moon shone upon the snow-clad
mountain, Summer&#8217;s roses
shed their scent, Autumn&#8217;s motley
cloak flapped in the wind,
Spring plucked at the strings of
his lute and hummed softly to its
music.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, the four
princes rose in their splendour
and their might, bowed low to
one another and strode slowly
away over the earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">THE END</p>
